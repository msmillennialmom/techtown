      <h2>Rise of the TechTown</h2>
        <p> Baltimore is quietly evolving into a “Mid-Atlantic” digital hub.</p>
        <p> In fact, Baltimore landed on CIO’s “10 Cities with Fast Emerging Tech Hubs” list last year.</p>
        <p> The nation’s rising tech industry is changing the employment landscape of this once “blue collar” town.</p>
        <p> Baltimore is historically known for being a culturally diverse melting pot.</p>
        <p> It is truly an eclectic blend of distinctive dialects, ethnicities and lifestyles.</p>
        <p> However, “Charm City” is slowly blossoming into a technological oasis for start-ups and entrepreneurship.</p>
        <p>Baltimore has began to take on a new identity as a “Tech Town.”</p>

      <h2>Headquaters Central</h2>
        <p>Last year, several innovative startups established their foundation on Baltimore’s rising economic horizon.</p>
        <p>ZeroFox, Localist, BrainScope, and Fearless are among the many tech firms that have “taken root” in the city.</p
        <p>Baltimore already serves as headquarters to over 300 tech firms.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="lowerleft-sec">
      <h2>Federal Investments</h2>
        <p>In March 2017, the federal government awarded the state of Maryland an estimated $200 million dollars for the development</p>
        <p> of technological infrastructure. Local tech firms and working professionals would highly benefit from having access to a</p>
        <p> modernized fiber optic system. In fact, Xfinity Cable, is set to start offering 1 gigabit internet service to Baltimore</p>
        <p> residents this summer. The Baltimore tech community will definitely have a technological advantage by having access to</p>
        <p> exceptionally high-speed internet.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="lower right-sec">
      <h2>Innovation Stations</h2>
        <p>Baltimore incubators sites including Betamore, Impact Hub, Open Works and City Garage, just to name a few.</p>
        <p>These spaces feature unique amenities to meet the demands of tech professionals. As a student currently enrolled</p>
        <p>in Betamore’s Front-End Development Course, I can truly attest to the benefits of matriculating at this academy.</p>
        <p>The state-of-the-art campus located in the heart of federal hill, offers an open-concept learning environment that</p>
        <p>inspires critical thinking and creativity. The academic staff go above the “call of duty” to ensure students are fully</p>
        <p>prepared to meet the high demands of the tech world. The instructors of this academy are noted and knowledgeable tech-industry</p>
        <p>experts. Betamore has equipped me with a quantitative skill-set that will create a  professional pathway into the lucrative tech</p>
        <p>industry. By having direct access to cutting-edge technology, I can create unique and powerful website.</p>
